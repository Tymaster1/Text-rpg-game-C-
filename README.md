This program implements a simple text-based RPG combat system in C. The player and a monster engage in turn-based combat, with the player able to choose between melee, ranged, and magic attacks, or attempt to run away. Each action is determined by a simulated roll of a die (20-sided for the player, 5-sided for the monster). The game continues until the player successfully escapes, the monster's HP is reduced to 0, or the player's HP reaches 0. Random outcomes and combat mechanics are used to add variety to the gameplay experience.
